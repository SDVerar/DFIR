My name is Sydney Verar and I am currently studying Digital Forensics and Information Assurance at Marshall Univeristy. I am originally starting for write ups in the Magnet CTFs and the upcoming Cellebrite CTF events. In the future I may end up posting other findings and event technology related that I come accross.
